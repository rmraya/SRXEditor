# SRXEditor

SRXEditor is a cross-platform editor of segmentation rules, designed to use Segmentation Rules eXchange (SRX) 2.0, the open XML-based standard published by LISA.

You can use SRXEditor to create new SRX files and edit existing ones. It also can be used for testing segmentation rules to ensure that they break text as expected.

SRXEditor includes a sample file in SRX 2.0 format with a default set of segmentation rules supporting most standard cases. It also includes segmentation rules specific for these languages:

 | | | | |

 Dutch |  Portuguese |  English | Spanish 
 Finnish | Swedish | French | Thai
